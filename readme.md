# üöÄ **Pneumonia Detection using X-ray Images with Transfer Learning (VGG16)**

This project demonstrates how to build a binary classifier to detect **pneumonia** from chest X-ray images using a pre-trained **VGG16** model for **transfer learning**. The goal is to accurately classify X-ray images as either **normal** or **pneumonia**.

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Overview**

In this project, we leverage **Keras**'s pre-trained **VGG16** model as a feature extractor, which has been trained on the **ImageNet** dataset. We use transfer learning to train the model on a pneumonia detection dataset. The key steps are:

1. **Data Preprocessing** and Augmentation
2. **Model Design** using VGG16 (Transfer Learning)
3. **Model Training** with Early Stopping
4. **Model Evaluation** using confusion matrix, AUC, and classification metrics
5. **Visualization** of training results and evaluation metrics

The output is a model that can predict whether an X-ray image shows **pneumonia** or **normal** lungs.

3. Download the Dataset
You can find the dataset for pneumonia X-ray detection on Kaggle:

Pneumonia X-ray Dataset on Kaggle
Make sure to download the dataset and upload it to the proper directory in your environment:

Train data: ../input/pneumonia-xray-images/train/
Validation data: ../input/pneumonia-xray-images/val/
Test data: ../input/pneumonia-xray-images/test/
Note: If you do not have access to Kaggle, you can use other public X-ray pneumonia datasets or create your own dataset with labeled X-ray images.

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Project
Open the Jupyter notebook pneumonia_detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Step-by-Step Guide:

Follow the instructions in each cell to preprocess the data, define the model, and train it.
The model uses VGG16 as a base model, and the top layers are re-trained on the pneumonia dataset.
During training, the model is evaluated on both training and validation sets, and you will see metrics such as accuracy, loss, confusion matrix, and the AUC score.
Train the Model:

The model will run for up to 30 epochs (configurable) and utilize early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation:

After training, the model is evaluated on the test dataset, and results like the confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score will be printed.
Visualization:

You‚Äôll also get visual plots for training/validation accuracy and loss across epochs.

üìä Model Evaluation Metrics
After training, the model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

Confusion Matrix: A 2x2 matrix showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Classification Report: Detailed precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy for both classes (Normal and Pneumonia).

ROC-AUC Score: The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score showing the model's ability to distinguish between the classes.

Note: The AUC score ranges from 0 to 1. A score closer to 1 indicates better model performance.

üìù Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the power of transfer learning and data augmentation for image classification tasks.
The ROC-AUC score and confusion matrix indicate that the model is effective at distinguishing between normal and pneumonia images.
üí° Conclusion
In this project, we successfully built a binary classification model using transfer learning with VGG16 to detect pneumonia from X-ray images. The model performs well in classification tasks, and the evaluation metrics show that it can be useful in clinical environments for pneumonia detection.
